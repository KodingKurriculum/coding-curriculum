# Overview

## Standards
### K12 Computer Science Framework Statements
**Algorithms**
By grade 2, people follow and create processes as part of daily life. Many of these processes can be expressed as algorithms that computers can follow.  
By grade 5, different algorithms can achieve the same result. Some algorithms are more appropriate for a specific context than others.  
**Modularity**
By grade 2, complex tasks can be broken down into simpler instructions, some of which can be broken down even further. Likewise, instructions can be combined to accomplish complex tasks.  
By grade 5, programs can be broken down into smaller parts to facilitate their design, implementation, and review. Programs can also be created by incorporating smaller portions of programs that have already been created.  

### New Jersey Learning Standards
Operations and Algebraic Thinking
D. Solve problems involving the four operations, and identify and explain patterns in arithmetic.
8. Solve two-step word problems using the four operations. Represent these problems using equations with a letter standing for the unknown quantity. Assess the reasonableness of answers using mental computation and estimation strategies including rounding.3
9. Identify arithmetic patterns (including patterns in the addition table or multiplication table), and explain them using properties of operations. For example, observe that 4 times a number is always even, and explain why 4 times a number can be decomposed into two equal addends

## Instructional Plan
### Session 1- KNOW
Objective: SWBAT analyze solutions to problems involving the four operations.
Anticipatory Set: Show a solved problem for the given operation. Ask students how they think it was solved. Repeat as necessary. Teacher explains that there are steps to solving problems. Not all problems are the same, but we there are patterns in the way we solve them. Teacher explains that the objective is to analyze solutions to problems and list the steps necessary to reach the solution.
Instruction: Teacher displays a solved problem and models how to read through and identify the steps to reach the solution. Create anchor chart “Steps for Solving [operation] Problems.” **SEE POWERPOINT**
Guided/Independent Practice: Students work in pairs to study solved problems. Students create steps to add to the anchor chart.
Assessment/Closure: Compile students’ ideas and add to anchor chart  “Steps for Solving [operation] Problems.”

### Session 2-ALGORITHM
Objective: SWBAT analyze solutions to problems and identify patterns.
Anticipatory Set: **SEE POWERPOINT** - Teacher shows a long shopping list  and explains how the items checked off were purchased and items crossed off were not necessary. Allow students to turn and talk about buying too much or having too many things on the list. Teacher explains that all mathematicians and coders go through a similar process for solving problems. The process gets simplified. The objective is to create an algorithm for solving a [operation] problem.
Instruction: Teacher displays anchor chart“Steps for Solving [operation] Problems.”
 and explains that the list is too long. It must be simplified. Teacher models how to evaluate and simplify the process for solving problems.
Guided/Independent Practice: Students work in pairs to create an algorithm.
Assessment/Closure: As a class, create an algorithm for solving [operation] problems.

### Session 3- TEST
Objective: SWBAT apply patterns and solve problems using the four operations.
Anticipatory Set: “Coders test their code! Today, we will put our algorithm for solving [operation] problems. to work!” Display algorithm for solving [operation] problems. Distribute **ALGORITHM CHECKLIST WITH EXAMPLE**
Instruction: Teacher models how to use the checklist to apply the algorithm. Teacher models a think aloud to solve the [operation] problem. Allow students to turn and talk about each step.
Guided/Independent Practice: Students work independently or in pairs to apply the algorithm to solve the problems with the given operation. Teacher may interrupt student work as new teaching points arise.
Assessment/Closure: Solved problems and algorithm checklist

### Session 4- DO
Objective: SWBAT assess and explain solutions.
Anticipatory Set:Teacher displays an inaccurate solution to a problem.  Students discuss how the errors affect the solution.  
Instruction: Teacher explains that when coders look for errors it’s called debugging and today students will debug their solutions. Create anchor chart “Debugging; What errors should I look for?” Display student work (remove names and get permission from the student). Teacher models how to use the algorithm checklist and debug a solved problem. Add errors to the anchor chart. **INACCURATE SOLUTION** **SEE POWERPOINT**
Guided/Independent Practice: Students identify errors within the solved problems.
Assessment/Closure: As a class, add errors to “Debugging; What errors should I look for?”

### Session 5- APPLY
Objective: SWBAT apply concepts of algorithms and debugging in Course 1, Lesson 5
Anticipatory Set: Show Debugging introduction video.
Instruction: Teacher models step one and show algorithm
**EAST-RIGHT, WEST- LEFT, NORTH- UP, SOUTH-DOWN**  
Guided/Independent Practice: Allow students to work at their own pace. Teacher guides certain steps:
 Step 3: Teacher show too many steps and how to simplify it.
Step 6: Have a pair of students act out the code.
Assessment/Closure: Completed Lesson 5: Maze: Debugging
