# Overview

## Standards
### K12 Computer Science Framework Statements
**Algorithms**
By grade 2, people follow and create processes as part of daily life. Many of these processes can be expressed as algorithms that computers can follow.
By grade 5, different algorithms can achieve the same result. Some algorithms are more appropriate for a specific context than others.
**Modularity**
By grade 2, complex tasks can be broken down into simpler instructions, some of which can be broken down even further. Likewise, instructions can be combined to accomplish complex tasks.
By grade 5, programs can be broken down into smaller parts to facilitate their design, implementation, and review. Programs can also be created by incorporating smaller portions of programs that have already been created.

### New Jersey Learning Standards
English Language Arts: Reading
Craft and Structure
NJSLSA.R5. Analyze the structure of texts, including how specific sentences, paragraphs, and larger portions of the text (e.g., a section, chapter, scene, or stanza) relate to each other and the whole.
RL.3.5. Refer to parts of stories, dramas, and poems when writing or speaking about a text, using terms such as chapter, scene, and stanza; describe how each successive part builds on earlier sections.
Key Ideas and Details
NJSLSA.R2. Determine central ideas or themes of a text and analyze their development; summarize the key supporting details and ideas.
Literature RL.3.2. Recount stories, including fables, folktales, and myths from diverse cultures; determine the central message/theme, lesson, or moral and explain how it is revealed through key details in the text.
English Language Arts: Writing
Text Types and Purposes
NJSLSA.W3. Write narratives to develop real or imagined experiences or events using effective technique, well-chosen details, and well-structured event sequences.
	•	Establish a situation and introduce a narrator and/or characters; organize an event sequence that unfolds naturally.
	•	Use dialogue and descriptions of actions, thoughts, and feelings to develop experiences and events or show the response of characters to situations.
	•	Use temporal words and phrases to signal event order.
	•	Provide a sense of closure.
W.3.5. With guidance and support from peers and adults, develop and strengthen writing as needed by planning, revising, and editing.

Instructional Plan
Session 1- KNOW
Objective:SWBAT analyze the structure of narrative text.
Anticipatory Set: Teacher displays and/or tells a story. Students discuss how the story was successful. Teacher explains that all stories follow a set of rules. Teacher explains that the objective is to analyze the structure of narrative text.
Instruction: Teacher displays a short story and models how to read and identify parts of a story. Create anchor chart “Rules for a Story.” ***SEE POWERPOINT
Guided/Independent Practice: Students work in pairs to study narrative texts. Students create rules to add to the anchor chart.
Assessment/Closure: Compile students’ ideas and add to anchor chart “Rules for a Story.”

Session 2-ALGORITHM
Objective:SWBAT analyze the structure of narrative text.
Anticipatory Set: ***SEE POWERPOINT- Teacher shows a long list of groceries and explains how the items checked off were purchased and items crossed off were not necessary. Allow students to turn and talk about buying too much or having too many things on the list. Teacher explains that all stories follow a set of rules. Those rules are simplified. The objective is to create an algorithm for writing a story.
Instruction: Teacher displays anchor chart “Rules for a Story” and explains that the list is too long. It must be simplified. Teacher models how to evaluate and simplify rules for a story.
Guided/Independent Practice: Students work in pairs to create an algorithm.
Assessment/Closure: As a class, create an algorithm for writing a story.

Session 3- TEST
Objective: SWBAT write narratives to develop real or imagined experiences or events.
Anticipatory Set: “Coders test their code! Today, we will put our algorithm for writing a story to work!” Display algorithm for writing a story. Distribute ***ALGORITHM CHECKLIST WITH EXAMPLE
Instruction: Teacher models how to use the checklist to apply the algorithm. Teacher models a think aloud to write the next part of the story/algorithm. Allow students to turn and talk about the next part.
Guided/Independent Practice: Students write what they discussed. Teacher continues to show the examples as necessary. Students may continue writing until the story and algorithm is completed. Teacher may prompt students to turn and talk about each part prior to writing.
Assessment/Closure: Completed story and algorithm checklist

Session 4- DO
Objective: SWBAT develop and strengthen writing.
Anticipatory Set:Teacher displays and/or tells a story that goes off task. Students discuss how the story fails.
Instruction: Teacher explains that when coders look for errors it’s called debugging and today students will debug their stories. When writers fix errors, they are editing and revising. Create anchor chart “Debugging; What errors should I look for?” Display student work (remove names and get permission from the student). Teacher models how to use the algorithm checklist and debug a story. Add errors to the anchor chart. ***OFF TASK STORY***SEE POWERPOINT
Guided/Independent Practice: Students read stories to edit and revise.
Assessment/Closure: As a class, add errors to “Debugging; What errors should I look for?”

Session 5- APPLY
Objective: SWBAT apply concepts of algorithms and debugging in Course 1, Lesson 5
Anticipatory Set: Show Debugging introduction video.
Instruction: Teacher models step one and show algorithm
***EAST-RIGHT, WEST- LEFT, NORTH- UP, SOUTH-DOWN
Guided/Independent Practice: Allow students to work at their own pace. Teacher guides certain steps:
 Step 3: Teacher show too many steps and how to simplify it.
Step 6: Have a pair of students act out the code.
Assessment/Closure: Completed Lesson 5: Maze: Debugging
